# NetVersionScanner
Provides details of the `TargetFramework` attribute of loaded assemblies.

Future project, not started yet. Will largely be a clone of the duplicate assembly scanner but edited to just list target framework for all loaded assemblies.

MSDN: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.versioning.targetframeworkattribute?view=netframework-4.8

Need to get AutoRepair mod finished first (ETA 2 weeks).
